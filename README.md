# Simplerr

Simplerr aims to provide a cleaner, more maintainable and rich Go error handling experience. 

Objectives:
- Highly customizable but with well chosen defaults
- Less boilerplate for error detection, propagation and translation 
- Standardized error codes
- Provide a middleware-friendly `error` implementation 
- Ability to distinguish between benign and non-benign errors
- Ability to ignore logging of benign errors
- More detailed error logging via contextual attributes
